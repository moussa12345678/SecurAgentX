"""securagentx.knowledge_graph — Knowledge Graph entity extraction & integration.

This subpackage ports PentAGI's Graphiti-backed knowledge-graph layer to
SecurAgentX. It is composed of four modules:

* ``graph``        — core primitives (:class:`Node`, :class:`Edge`,
  :class:`NodeLabel`, :class:`EdgeType`, :class:`Episode`,
  :class:`Community`, :class:`KnowledgeGraph`) backed by NetworkX +
  SQLite. Provided by Task 5-a.
* ``extractor``    — :class:`EntityExtractor` regex + LLM extraction of
  entities (IPs, domains, URLs, ports, CVEs, hashes, credentials,
  file paths, service banners, emails) and relationships
  (``HAS_PORT``, ``EXPLOITS``, ``MENTIONS``, ``WORKS_ON``,
  ``DISCOVERED_BY``, ``RELATED_TO``).
* ``integration``  — :class:`KnowledgeGraphIntegration` wires the
  extractor + KnowledgeGraph into VulnAgent's reasoning loop via
  ``on_agent_response`` / ``on_tool_execution`` /
  ``on_finding_discovered`` / ``get_relevant_context`` hooks. All hooks
  are no-ops when the KG is disabled.
* ``community``    — :class:`CommunityDetector` runs NetworkX's Louvain
  (with greedy-modularity fallback) over the per-flow subgraph and
  summarises / merges the resulting communities.

Design constraints
------------------
* All public APIs are ``async``.
* Heavy dependencies (``networkx``, the LLM client SDK) are lazy-imported
  inside methods so the package can be AST-validated without them.
* Each module degrades gracefully when ``graph.py`` (Task 5-a) is absent
  via try/except fallback stubs — the package is importable in isolation.
