1. What do we actually KNOW from the evidence so far? List 2-3 concrete facts.
2. What is the most promising attack vector RIGHT NOW, and why?
3. What is the single highest-value next probe? Be specific: command or endpoint.
4. What could go wrong with that probe? What's the fallback?
5. Are we stuck on a pattern? Should we pivot — and to what?
6. If you had ONE more command to run, what is it and what would the
   output tell us?

Reply as plain prose. Do NOT call tools. Do NOT output JSON."""
