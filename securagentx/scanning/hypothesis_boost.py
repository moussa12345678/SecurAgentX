"""agents/hypothesis_boost.py

Hypothesis-driven boost for stuck scan states.

Background (PentestPad, 2026): AI is good at recognising known vulnerability
patterns but much weaker at the *creative, hypothesis-driven thinking* that
discovers genuinely novel attack paths — the off-script instinct of an
experienced red teamer.

When the DecisionEngine reflection reports the scan is "stuck", we surface a
set of hypothesis-generation prompts that push the agent off the recognised
pattern and onto a fresh, untested attack path. This is a pure prompt/meta
layer: it never executes an action, only shapes what the AI is asked to
consider next. Keeps the agent from looping on the same low-hanging fruit.
