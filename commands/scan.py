"""commands/scan.py — Scan Command Handler (Unified → True AI Agent)

Replaces the old script-driven scan pipeline with a VulnAgent-based
autonomous vulnerability scanning agent. Every scan path — full, phase,
interactive — now delegates to the AI agent which reasons about what
tools to use, in what order, and how to pivot.

Usage:
    securagentx scan <target>                    — Full VulnAgent scan
    securagentx scan <target> --phase recon      — (redirected: AI decides phases)
    securagentx scan --interactive bola <url>    — (redirected: AI-driven)
