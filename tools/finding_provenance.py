Finding Provenance — deterministic vs agentic classification.

Why this exists:
    A deterministic scanner module (active fuzzer, passive pattern matcher,
    signature check) produces the *same* finding for the *same* input every
    run. An LLM-driven agent that plans its own attack path and writes its
    own probes is the opposite: powerful on a good day, non-deterministic by
    construction, and very hard to regression-test.

    Per the Vigolium/diviner critique (Moltbook, 2026-05-29): a finding from
    the deterministic pipeline and a finding from the agent should NEVER sit
    in the same queue without a tag saying which produced it. This module
    makes that tag first-class so the rest of SecurAgentX (dedup, reporting,
    governance) can treat the two trust classes differently.

Usage:
    from tools.finding_provenance import tag_provenance, Provenance

    finding = tag_provenance(finding, source_hint="ai_reasoning")
    # finding["provenance"] == "agentic"
    # finding["trust_class"]  == "non_deterministic"

The classification is derived from the existing "source"/"tool" field when
present, so legacy findings are auto-classified without code changes上游.
