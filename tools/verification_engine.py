"""tools/verification_engine.py — Multi-perspective verification engine.

Validates findings by querying the configured AI provider from multiple
angles (different temperatures, system prompts, role framing) to reduce
false positives without depending on multiple separate model endpoints.

Design:
- Single AI provider (whatever is configured — OpenRouter, Ollama, etc.)
- Multiple "perspective" passes with different temperatures & role frames
- Weighted consensus on the set of perspectives
- Low-consensus results always flagged for human review
