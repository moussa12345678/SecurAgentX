"""agents/vuln_reasoning_phase.py

The autonomous vulnerability-reasoning phase.

Why this exists
--------------
The original scan loop was "tool-chaining with an AI on top": deterministic
scanners and the 14-analyzer pipeline produced the findings, and the AI only
chose *which* tool to run next. The AI never *reasoned a vulnerability into
existence* from raw evidence — it could not, because nothing asked it to.

This phase closes that gap. After each action the loop hands the raw tool
output + observation to the LLM reasoning engine, which is free to:
  - form vulnerability hypotheses the static analyzers cannot see,
  - turn a hypothesis into a finding on its own authority,
  - propose the next test to confirm/refute it.

No hardcoded step list, no forced sequence. The AI decides what it thinks is
a vulnerability. This is what makes SecurAgentX an *agent* rather than a wrapper.

Integration
-----------
ScanLoop calls ``run_reasoning_phase(ctx, raw_output, observation, step)`` in
the post-execute phase. Hypotheses returned by the engine become findings
tagged ``source="ai_reasoning"`` (see tools/finding_provenance.py) so they
are never silently merged with deterministic tool output.
